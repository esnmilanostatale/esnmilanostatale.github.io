  <p>If you are reading this guide, it means that you are coming to Milan for your Erasmus, so congratulations!</p>
  <p>In Italy we care a lot about making people feel at home, and we hope that the ESN Milano Statale crew will be able

  <p>Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is the biggest student association in Europe. It was born on the 16<sup>th</sup>
    October 1989 and legally registered in 1990 for supporting and developing student exchange.</p>
  <p>We are present in more than 1000 Higher Education Institutions from 41 countries.</p>
  <p>We have around 15,000 active members that are in many sections supported by so-called buddies mainly taking care of
    international students.</p>
  <p>Thus, ESN involves around 40,000 young people offering its services to around 350,000 international students every
    year.</p>
  <p>ESN is operating on three levels: local, national, and international.<br /><img alt="europe_img.png"

  </p>&nbsp;<h2 id="esn-a-milano-unita">ESN a Milano unita</h2>

  <p>ESN Milano Statale is the ESN section of the Università degli Studi di Milano, and its headquarter is inside the
    University building (<em>via Festa del Perdono 7</em>).</p>
  <p>We are a group of students and we organize any kind of activities for the Erasmus, from the recreative ones (like
    traveling bar), to the more cultural ones (like city tours and exhibitions) but also sport tournaments, social
    inclusion activities and trips all over Italy.</p>
  <p>We take our volunteering as a mission: our goal is to create the best experience possible in Milan for our Erasmus
    students.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="esncard">ESNcard</h2>

  <p>To register to our events, you usually have to pass to our office to pay and register for an event.</p>
  <p>But we have also other ways to get you register easily. We usually use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Google forms;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bank Transfers;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>PayPal<br />To pay you can directly send money to <a
          href="mailto:tesoriere@esnmilanostatale.it">tesoriere@esnmilanostatale.it</a> or connect to this link: <a
          href="http://paypal.me/esnmilanostatale">http://paypal.me/esnmilanostatale</a>.<br /><u>Pay attention</u>: on
        PayPal it is necessary to pay an increased fee due the commissions. Just ask to our staff!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Verse<br />A partnership between ESN Italia and Verse has recently been created to facilitate payments.</p>
      <p>Verse is a service that allows Erasmus to pay online for any need. For exchanges of money between Verse users
        there are no commissions, this makes the service convenient</p>
      <p>In addition, everyone can exchange money according to their needs. The result is a gain not only for the
        exchange between the ESN section and the interested parties, but also among the users themselves.</p>
      <p>This is the <a href="https://verse.me/download?ref=7QTBPN">link</a> to use and to download the application.</p>
      <p>This is the <a href="https://verse.me/pay?to=2n1h8taa3eb8lfi9d3kg">link</a> of ESN Milano Statale to pay and

  <h2 id="one-of-the-youngest-university-in-italy">One of the youngest university in Italy</h2>
  <p>Also known as &lsquo;La Statale&rsquo;, the University of Milan is, relatively speaking, one of Italy&rsquo;s
    younger university institutions. It was founded in 1924 thanks to the tenacious efforts of doctor and gynaecologist
    Luigi Mangiagalli, who in creating La Statale, realised his long-held dream of building a university for
    Lombardy&rsquo;s regional capital.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="the-founder">The founder</h2>
  <p>A representative of the Chamber of Deputies in 1902 and later mayor of Milan, Mangiagalli, together with a group of
    Milanese members of the Association for the Promotion of High Culture, set about creating the city&rsquo;s very
    first university.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="university-system">University system</h2>
  <p>Another key step forward came with the reform of the university system which introduced the distinction between the
    Laurea triennale (Bachelor&rsquo;s degree) and the Laurea magistrale(Master&rsquo;s degree). Since the reform was
    first applied by the University in the 2001-2002 academic year, the number of degree courses on offer has increased
    from 47 to 74.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="university-office-hours-and-infopoint">University office hours and Infopoint</h2>

  <h2 id="the-city">The City</h2>
  <p>Milano is the second most populated city in Italy, with an urban centre that counts more than 1 372 000
    inhabitants. Universally recognized as the Fashion Capital, the city lays right at the centre of Europe, proving to
    be a fundamental crossroad for economy and a vivid cultural meltin&rsquo; pot.</p>
  <p>Boasting the 3rd largest economy in Europe, after Paris and London, a fascinating history and 2 of the most
    decorated football team in the world: A.C. Milan and F.C. Inter.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="duomo">Duomo</h2>

  </p>
  <p>The Duomo di Milano is the Gothic cathedral church of Milan, dedicated to St. Mary of the Nativity, with at top the
    &lsquo;Madonnina Statue&rsquo;, that is visible during the sunny days.</p>
  <p>This is the symbol for the city of Milan and until a few years ago it was the highest point in the whole city.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The Castello Sforzesco di Milano (in english Sforza Castle) was considered for centuries an emblem of tyranny and
    foreign domination.</p>
  <p>It was built from Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan in the 15th century and now is an incredible museum that you can
    visit!</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="piazzale-cadorna">Piazzale Cadorna</h2>

  </p>
  <p>Piazzale Cadorna (Cadorna Square) is dedicated to one of the Italian army chiefs during the First World War, Luigi
    Cadorna. It is sited in the centre of Milan, near Cadorna Railway Station. In the square is located the sculpture
    Needle, Thread and Knot (Ago, Filo e Nodo) made at the start of 2000. The sculpture was made by Claes Oldenburg and
    Coosje van Bruggen.</p>
  <p>This enormous piece comprises a 19-metre tall steel needle, stuck into the ground, and a multi-colour reinforced
    fibreglass thread, 86 metres long, that pops up in another point of the square with a knot on its end. It is not a
    coincidence that the sculpture disappears underground as it features the colours of the first 3 underground lines,
    linking above and below. One of the new symbols of Milan, it is a tribute to the creative and hardworking nature of
    the Milanese and Milan fashion.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="piazza-affari-–-borsa-italiana">Piazza Affari &ndash; Borsa

  </p>
  <p>Not too far from the Duomo Cathedral, from the Sforza Castle and from Cadorna there is Piazza Affari, where the
    Italian Stock Exchange has its headquarters. In the square there is an iconic sculture: it is a marble statue
    depicting a hand with only its middle finger standing up. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll see that the other
    fingers are not flexed, but they look as if they were cut off.</p>
  <p>The impression is the same nevertheless: an unambiguous &ldquo;giving the finger&rdquo; to the world of bankers and
    CEOs. The statue bears the title of L.O.V.E., which stands for Libertà, Odio, Vendetta, Eternità (Freedom, Hate,
    Vengeance, Eternity) and was created in 2010 by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, known for his provocative
    works. The statue was supposed to stay in Piazza Affari for just a couple of weeks, but the city government decided
    to keep it there indefinitely.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="teatro-alla-scala">Teatro alla Scala</h2>

  </p>
  <p>The Teatro alla Scala of Milan is an opera house. It was inaugurated on 3rd August 1778 and originally known as the
    Nuovo Regio Ducale Teatro alla Scala. Designed by the great neoclassical architect Giuseppe Piermarini, La Scala
    opened on 3rd August 1778 with Antonio Salieri&rsquo;s opera L&rsquo;Europa riconosciuta, to a libretto by Mattia
    Verazi.</p>
  <p>With the ESN card we could get special prices to see shows at Teatro alla Scala, don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity!

  </p>
  <p>With ancient origins and full of history, Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace of Milan) today serves as a cultural centre,
    hosting also expositions and exhibition.</p>
  <p>A work also rewarded by the public: with a result that for years has consistently exceeded one million visitors a
    year, the exhibitions of Palazzo Reale are increasingly leading the ranking of the most visited ones in Italy.</p>
  &nbsp;<h2 id="piazza-gae-aulenti">Piazza Gae Aulenti</h2>

  </p>
  <p>Piazza Gae Aulenti represents the new face of the city, the symbol of a metropolis that is changing and looking
    ahead to the future. Designed by the Argentine architect Cesar Pelli as a stunning new gateway to Milan, it was
    inaugurated on December 8th, 2012 and dedicated to the architect and designer Gae Aulenti.</p>
  <p>A significant accolade to a woman who, thanks to her extraordinary creative talent, managed to distinguish herself
    in times, and in a profession, that was predominantly male. Paved with slate, it is surrounded by two levels of
    canopies in iron, wood and glass built in accordance with the principles of eco-sustainability; it is covered with
    solar panels that provide power for the three adjacent towers.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="navigli">Navigli</h2>

  </p>
  <p>This area is undergoing substantial renovation and is considered one of the most charming residential areas of the
    city. The neighborhood is always buzzing by day it is the location for many markets, art galleries and craft shops,
    at night it is illuminated by the lights of masses of bars and restaurants making it one of the most lively and
    attractive districts of the city.</p>
  <p>In fact Milano&rsquo;s Navigli canals were set up as a waterway system used to transport people and goods for
    irrigation.</p>
  <p>Curiosity: The marble for the construction of the Duomo, which came from the Candoglia quarry, was transported
    along the Naviglio Grande from the river Toce and Lake Maggiore.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="cimitero-monumentale">Cimitero

  </p>
  <p>The Cimitero Monumentale is an authentic open-air museum, freely accessible every day, which regularly hosts
    readings, concerts and tours. The Monumental Cemetery, more than just a simple cemetery, is an extraordinary outdoor
    museum. It is as if some of the great sculptors of the 1900s were called together to elaborate and reflect on a
    particularly demanding theme, to be precise, death.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="san-siro-stadio">San Siro Stadio</h2>

  </p>
  <p>The San Siro stadium, whose construction was brought about by the then-president of A.C. Milan Piero Pirelli, was
    built in 1925 in the neighbourhood with which it shares its name. At the beginning it was the official football
    field for A.C. Milan. In 1947 it became the official location for Inter as well. In 1980, the San Siro stadium was
    named after Giuseppe Meazza, who had been a football star not only for Inter, for which he made his debut at 17, but
    for Milan as well.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="tre-torri--citylife">Tre Torri / Citylife</h2>

  </p>
  <p>In a round square with a metaphysical atmosphere, designed by Vittoriano Viganò, the Arco della Pace is structured
    like a triumphal arch with three arches, with 4 colossal fluted Corinthian columns and an arch greater than 14.24 m,
    entirely in granite of Baveno and covered in Crevola d&rsquo;Ossola stone.</p>
  <p>On the attic was placed the bronze sculptural group of the Sestiga della Pace with four Victories on horseback.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Together with the Duomo, the Basilica of Sant&rsquo;Ambrogio is the cradle of history and spirituality in Milano
    and a treasure trove of sacred art.</p>
  <p>Great popular devotion revolves around the basilica that has always been a destination</p>

  </p>
  <p>Santa Maria delle Grazie, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an exceptional testament to Renaissance architecture in
    Milano, is a fundamental monument for visitors who wish to fully appreciate the historical splendours of the city.
    The church of Santa Maria delle Grazie is inextricably linked to the unrivalled masterpiece in the convent&rsquo;s

    crops. Without moving far from the centre of Milan, nature lovers can savour long and invigorating walks, or ride
    their bicycles, in this forest, where you can breathe some real country air.</p>
  <p>How to get there: with bus 80 (via S. Romanello, Via Novara) or with bus 423 (Via Togni, Via S. Romanello)</p>

  <h2 id="weather">Weather</h2>
  <p>Moving to another country means facing completely different conditions than what you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s start from the weather.</p>
  <p>Italy is famous to be a warm and sunny country, which is true, but don&rsquo;t forget Milan is in the North and
    close to the mountains.</p>
  <p>Autumn and winter are usually rainy seasons and it snows really few times. It&rsquo;s usually cold, between 9&deg;
    and 15&deg; degrees Celsius in autumn and 0&deg; and 10&deg; degrees Celsius in winter.</p>
  <p>On the other side we have spring and summer. Still some rains during the first months of spring, but the
    temperature starts to raise, and sun and warm from May on. Summer can be really hot and humid, from the middle of
    June to the end of September, with temperatures usually from 25&deg; to 35&deg; degrees Celsius. There may be some
    storms, but they usually last few minutes and then the sun comes out again.</p>
  <p>For autumn and spring in particular, which are the middle seasons, we suggest what we call &ldquo;onion
    clothes&rdquo;: always wear different strata of clothes so you can catch up with the changes in temperature and
    weather during the day!</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
  <p>Regarding the currency, Italy is one of the 19 countries of the Eurozone.</p>
  <p>Milan is one of the most advanced cities of Italy, so you won&rsquo;t have problems paying by card, any App for the
    mobile, or any new type of payment mode. However, in smaller cities or villages around Italy, they may not have all
    those systems, which will require payment by cash. We suggest, anyway, to always have 10/20 euros cash with you for
    any inconvenience!</p>
  <p>Mostly when you go out with a group of people, some pubs or restaurants in Italy don&rsquo;t let you pay for your
    consumption, but they make a single check. It&rsquo;s an Italian custom to pay &ldquo;allaromana&rdquo; (lit. Roman
    way), which means the final check equally divided per the number of participants.</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="milanese-people">
    Milanese people</h2>
  <p>Milan is known to be a very dynamic and lively city. People moving really fast around the streets to get to work or
    university is the normality, try not to interrupt their rush</p>
  <p>On the escalators, for instance, stand always only on the right side, so that people who have to run can pass on
    the left!</p>&nbsp;<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
  <p>Italian language could seem difficult, but don&rsquo;t worry, in a short time you will learn it! For your very
    first days in Italy, here some basics of the language:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ciao = Hello</li>
    <li>Come stai? = How are you?</li>
    <li>Bungiorno = Good morning</li>
    <li>Buonasera = Good evening</li>
    <li>Grazie = Thank you</li>
    <li>Prego = You&rsquo;re welcome</li>
    <li>Per favore = Please</li>
    <li>Mi chiamo &hellip; = My name is &hellip;</li>
    <li>Sinistra = Left</li>
    <li>Destra = Right</li>
    <li>Vorrei un caffè, perfavore = I would like an espresso, please (when you order coffee in Italy, it automatically
      means espresso)</li>
    <li>Io vengo da&hellip; = I come from&hellip;</li>
